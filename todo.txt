- (x) Ability to save Vectors, RNG seeds, and Colors, maybe more via serialization
- (?) Stupid mod-proof? Use multiple different collectible RNGs as to avoid one mod messing save data up entirely. If the first one fails (Sad Onion) look at the next one
- (done) Allow for alt saves (Forgotten and Soul share a save, give the option of separating them, but also allow it for anyone if so desired)
- (done) Copy entire save data of current room for treasure/boss ascent, not just pickups
- (done) rename roomFloor save to room, rename room save to temp
- (done) get/tryget for pickup noreroll and reroll saves instead of asking people to make their own (I honestly keep forgetting this myself)
- (done) fix for glowing hourglass
- (done) copy data of identical init seed pickups on init
- (done) save data for bombs
- (done) save data for persistent npcs
- (done) fix for curse of the maze (ListIndex remains but it swaps rooms entirely. Decoration/SpawnSeed is consistent, save it for every room and search for it if it doesn't match)
- (done) callbacks for various things (RIGHT when data loads for something, can specify entity type. when flipping, when rerolling, when a duplicate loads data)
- (done) Make not so annoying way of calling callbacks (Mod.SaveManager.AddCallback(Mod.SaveManager.Utility.CustomCallback.THE_NAME, theFunc), when we could be doing somethin like Mod:AddCallback(Mod.SaveCallback.THE_NAME, theFunc))
- (done) setup MenuProvider for DSS save
- (done) save data for grid entities done with indexes instead of vectors
- (done) minimapai support
- (done) optimize removing leftover data
- (done) whitelist instead of blacklist for valid data types, meaning instead of checking for functions, it checks for anything that aren't tables, booleans, strings, or integers
- (done) slots non-rgon will init on new room if present. being spawned while already in the room will still need it to run into a framecount of 1
