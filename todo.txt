- Ability to save Vectors, RNG seeds, and Colors, maybe more via serialization
- Stupid mod-proof? Use multiple different collectible RNGs as to avoid one mod messing save data up entirely. If the first one fails (Sad Onion) look at the next one
- Allow for alt saves (Forgotten and Soul share a save, give the option of separating them, but also allow it for anyone if so desired)
- (done) Copy entire save data of current room for treasure/boss ascent, not just pickups
- (done) rename roomFloor save to room, rename room save to temp
- (done) get/tryget for pickup noreroll and reroll saves instead of asking people to make their own (I honestly keep forgetting this myself)
- (done) fix for glowing hourglass
- (done) copy data of identical init seed pickups on init
- (done) save data for bombs
- (done) fix for curse of the maze (ListIndex remains but it swaps rooms entirely. Decoration/SpawnSeed is consistent, save it for every room and search for it if it doesn't match)
- callbacks for various things (RIGHT when data loads for something, can specify entity type. when flipping, when rerolling, when a duplicate loads data)
- (done) Make not so annoying way of calling callbacks (Mod.SaveManager.AddCallback(Mod.SaveManager.Utility.CustomCallback.THE_NAME, theFunc), when we could be doing somethin like Mod:AddCallback(Mod.SaveCallback.THE_NAME, theFunc))
- (done) setup MenuProvider for DSS save
